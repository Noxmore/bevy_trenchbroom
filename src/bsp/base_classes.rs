/// `ericw-tools` qbsp has a prefab system using a point entity named “misc_external_map”.
/// The idea is, each “misc_external_map” imports brushes from an external .map file,
/// applies rotations specified by the “_external_map_angles” key,
/// then translates them to the “origin” key of the “misc_external_map” entity.
/// Finally, the classname of the “misc_external_map” is switched to the one provided by the mapper in the “_external_map_classname” key.
/// (The “origin” key is also cleared to “0 0 0” before saving the .bsp).
///
/// The external .map file should consist of worldspawn brushes only, although you can use func_group for editing convenience.
/// Brush entities are merged with the worldspawn brushes during import.
/// All worldspawn keys, and any point entities are ignored.
/// Currently, this means that the “wad” key is not handled,
/// so you need to add any texture wads required by the external .map file to your main map.
///
/// Note that you can set other entity keys on the “misc_external_map” to configure the final entity type.
/// e.g. if you set “_external_map_classname” to “func_door”,
/// you can also set a “targetname” key on the “misc_external_map”, or any other keys for “func_door”.
